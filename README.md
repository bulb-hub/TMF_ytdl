# YTDL (youtube-dl/yt-dlp)
A TrackMania (Nations/United) Forever server (XASECO) plugin which allows players to search for YouTube uploads (`/youtube <query>`), as well as submit direct links of various media (`/ytdl <url>`), to be downloaded by the server and used as music.

This plugin assumes you have runnable versions of [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (as well as [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)) added to your `PATH`.
